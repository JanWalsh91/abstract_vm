âœ” Create c++ Makefile
- Consider split project into two sections / classes
	- Lexer / Tokenizer
		- Reads input
		- Converts input to list of tokens
		- Validates tokens and list of tokens
			- lexical or syntactic errors
			- unknown instruction
			- program has no exit instruction
			- ...
	- Parser
		- Parses and executes list of tokens
		- Throws runtime errors
			- over/underflow
			- pop on empty stack
			- less than 2 values when calling arithmetic function
			- assert instruction not true
			- arithmetic error (div. mod by 0)
			- ...
- Read from file
- Read form standard output
	- When reading from the standard input, the end of the program is indicated
	by the special symbol ";;" otherwise absent.
- Figure out exactly input formatting
- Find library to help with parsing (boost::spirit ?)




IOperand Interface 
- parent of child operand classes:
	- int8, int16, int32, loat, double

Operand Factory

eOperandType
- enum: Int8, ..., Double
